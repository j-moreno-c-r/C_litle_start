This is the compiling comand with the warning flags:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic  "Name of the file" -o "Name do you want to the executable file"
```
In Unix basement systems run the compiled file with:
```bash
./"Name of the compiled file."
```
For compiling in Nixos use the nixenv:
```bash
 nix-shell -p gcc11
```
